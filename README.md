# Noah-OWP-Modular CMake

This repo contains a CMake build environment for the refactored version of the Noah-MP community land surface model.

## Dependencies

Noah-OWP-Modular has been tested on Unix-based systems such as MacOS and Linux. Its only dependency is NetCDF Fortran.

This CMake project builds the codebase outside of the source directory tree. The original codebase was PR #100 of noah-owp-modular.
Setup: copy these files to the matching noah-owp-modular directory structure.

Before building the codebase, you will need to move some source files. Moving these source files simplifies the build:
<ul>
  <li>mv bmi/bmi_noahowp.f90 src/.</li>
  <li>mv driver/AsciiReadModule.f90 src/.</li>
  <li>mv driver/OutputModule.f90 src/.</li>
  </ul>
Once these changes are make in the noah-owp-modular source directory, these files will not need to be moved.
## Usage
From noah-owp-modular directory type:
<pre>
 Usage: from noah-owp-modular directory type:
 mkdir ../build
 cd ../build
 cmake ../noah-owp-modular
 cmake --build . -- VERBOSE=1
 cd ../noah-owp-modular/run
 ../../build/noah-owp-modular.exe namelist.input
 cd ../test
 ../../build/noahowp_driver_test.exe ../run/namelist.input
